# Numerical-Methods 
#Goal: 
  1) Solve multiple classes of ODEs and PDEs numerically using common numerical methods 
  2) Graph the numerical solution 
  2) Use Python as language of choice to demonstrate OOP ability
  
#Contents: 
  1) Python functions for numerically solving common classes of ODEs and PDEs. 
    a) Ex: Hamiltonians, Heat Equation, scalar ODEs, etc.
  2) All functions contain sample ODEs and/or PDEs for passing through implementation
  3) Some functions contain mathplot.lib implementations for graphing solutions 
  
#Primary Libraries (non-exhaustive): 
  1) mathplot.lib
  2) numpy 
  3) scipy.linalg
